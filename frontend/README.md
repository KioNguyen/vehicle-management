### Some Things To Note

- We've installed axios to help you make http requests
- We've defined some preset breakpoints in `src/styles/theme.ts`


## Part 1

1. Create a page with a simple form for adding vehicles into your `vehicles` table

2. Integrate the endpoint you created on the backend to add a vehicle with this form

3. Add about 5-6 vehicles into your table, you will be using these vehicles for the next part


## Part 2

1. Create a page that will display vehicles from your `vehicles` table

2. Feel free to display the vehicles in any way you want, some examples: Cards, Tables, etc

3. Integrate the endpoint you created on the backend to retrieve all the vehicles and display them in the format you have chosen
